Web Scraping Script to create a Fire Emblem Awakening Sqlite Database.

## Purpose

Serene's Forest has been a well regarded source for Fire Emblem Awaknening Information.
The only problem is its text based. In this sqlite databse, I am attempting to create a
sqlite equivalent of all the data on Serene's Forest, such that it may be used programtically
and perfomantly for other people's applications.

## Database

You should be able to copy paste the database into your projects because its sqlite.

The `main.go` script is provided so that you are able to generate all the correct data
from Serene's Forest.
